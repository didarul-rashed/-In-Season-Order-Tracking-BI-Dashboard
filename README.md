## 🔎 Project Overview
A compact yet powerful production visibility system for manufacturing companies.

For confidentiality, the data shown here is **dummy / anonymized** while maintaining the **same structure, rules, and logics** as the actual project.  
👉 This ensures the business problem is clearly demonstrated while respecting organizational data privacy.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In many manufacturing organizations, production teams struggle with one key question:<br>
**“Which order is currently in which stage?”**

When managing multiple factories, customers, styles, and hundreds of active orders, tracking progress manually becomes:

- **❌ Time-consuming**
- **❌ Error-prone**
- **❌ Non-transparent**
- **❌ Difficult to escalate delays**<br>
Without real-time stage visibility, delays are discovered too late — affecting shipment timelines, customer satisfaction, and revenue.

## 🚀 Solution Delivered
### 1. **Commercial Exception Monitoring**
- On Track / Delay KPIs for PI, LC, Clearance, and Payments  
- Delay categorization (1–3 days, 4–6 days, 7–9 days, >10 days)  
- Root cause analysis from remarks columns  
- Exception summaries with interactive drill-down  

### 2. **Logistics Tracking**
- Integrated **shipment milestones**: ETD, Vessel, Offload, In-house  
- Built **turnaround monitoring** for Customs, GRN, and Dox handling  
- Visualized **days delayed vs. standard lead time**  
- Created **connected view** between commercial commitments and logistics execution
